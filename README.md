# Computer networks : configuration and management, ISP simulation with Frrouting
During the last 6 weeks, we have played the role of a network engineer simulating a large ISP.



## Used technologies : 
- BGP
- OSPF
- Route Reflectors
- Firewall
- Mako/Python

## How to run the project : 
There you can see our general code structure : <br />
|-- grp7_cfg << contains all the router's configuration file <br />
|-- scripts << contains all python script in order to automate configuration file generation for our router, based on Json input <br />
**instructions** : Deploy project (local): <br />
1. Run the script initiate_connection.sh in order to create the network of router <br />
2. Run the script router_auto_test.py, this script will ping every router interfaces of our network to test the reachability of any point <br />
3. All the test result will be printed out in the file pingResult-output.txt <br />

From now on, the network is correctly running
