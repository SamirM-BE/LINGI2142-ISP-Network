During the last 6 weeks, we have played the role of a network engineer in a large Internet service provider company

There you can see our general code structure : <br />

|-- scripts << contains all python script in order to automate configuration file generation for our router, based on Json input <br />
**instructions** : Deploy project (local): <br />
1. Run the script initiate_connection.sh in order to create the network of router <br />
2. Run the script router_auto_test.py, this script will ping every router interfaces of our network to test the reachability of any point <br />
